# Challenge #1
# Create a Python script that removes all the elements of a list that are duplicates.
l1 = [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3]
s1 = set(l1)
print(l1)

# Challenge 2
# Consider a list of words (strings). Write a Python script that generates a dictionary 
# where the key is the word in the list and the value is its length.

words = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Golang', 'Solidity', 'Bash']
lengths = dict()
for word in word:
  lengths[word] = len(word)
